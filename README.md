 100HoursProject

This is the 100 Hours Project for Darkshadows61 (Thomas Bisom)

This project is meant to recreate and improve every aspect of the Bungie website to make it more modern and functional for current users.

I have ideas for some additional pages...
    Destiny Fashion previews
    Damage Calculator
    Low data and simple News feed
    Vault manager on main site
    PvP focus area
    PvE focus area


    maybe this should be the page vs a knock off duplicate
